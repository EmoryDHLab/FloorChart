## Keypad library for Arduino

**Authors:**  *Mark Stanley***,** *Alexander Brevig***,** *Noah Sutter*


This repository is an edited (by Noah Sutter) copy of the code found here (by  Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig) [[Arduino Playground]](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad).

The source and file structure has been modified to conform to the newer `1.5r2` library specification and is not compatible with legacy IDE's.
For these IDE's, visit the link above to grab the pre `1.0` compatible version, or download it directly here:  [[pre `1.0` version]](http://playground.arduino.cc/uploads/Code/keypad.zip).
